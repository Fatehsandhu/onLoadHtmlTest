# onLoad HTML Test

[Link to the website](https://svitlana-galianova.github.io/onLoadHtmlTest/test.html)
This test is a very basic HTML page with some JavaScript that tries to do the following:
- load an img with a given src (use any image URL you want)
- make sure the onload event fires
- after the first onload is completed, update the img.src.
- make sure a second onload event fires. If the second event fires, the test passes. If not, it fails.

I used CSS to indicate if the test passed or failed (if it's pink after pressing the button - failed, if it's blue - passed)
